# About this project
This project was developed during the Omnistack week edition 11 organized by Rockectseat. In fact, it's a week during which the organizer proposes a full stack javascript project (nodejs, reactjs and react native) and we realize it together with him. 

Be the hero is an application that allows NGOs to find potential financial partners in case of major need to solve its problems.


# Why?
Because it allows to master several technologies around this javascript stack, and in the end realize an application that made sense for the market using the concept of uberisation.

Also, you can use this project as you wish, be for study, be for make improvements or earn money with it!
It's free!
